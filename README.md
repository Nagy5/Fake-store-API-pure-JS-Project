"I just completed an assignment for my MEAN-stack course, where I had to build everything using pure JavaScript without any frameworks. During the process, I found it difficult to find examples of others doing something similar, which made it harder to learn from. Because of that, Iâ€™ve decided to share my project, hoping it might help anyone else who finds themselves in the same situation I was in."
