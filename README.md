"I just completed an assignment for my MEAN-stack course, where I had to build everything using pure JavaScript without any frameworks. During the process, I found it difficult to find examples of others doing something similar, which made it harder to learn from. Because of that, I’ve decided to share my project, hoping it might help anyone else who finds themselves in the same situation I was in."


"I got the idea for the style of the first part of the website from this YouTube video — definitely check out his channel; he's a great creator! Also, a huge shoutout to ChatGPT, which was incredibly helpful throughout the project. If you ever find yourself stuck, I highly recommend using it (I even used it to write comments for the project!)."
